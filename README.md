# Create a summary view of the main events of your life!
Website to generate a summary of your life by entering your birth date and filling a template. It is based on [this](https://busterbenson.com/life-in-weeks) and [this](https://days.rory.codes/) websites, but allowing anyone to just fill an excel template, upload it, and the website does everything for you.

You can try it out [here](https://julian-guillo.github.io/your-life-in-weeks/). It's browser based, so it will run only in your computer, I won't be receiving any data.
